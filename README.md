The Web of Things framework by WoT.City. It contains various WoT servers, including websocket broker WoT server, CoAP WoT server and etc. 

## Broker Servers

Broker servers are not running on IoT devices. The current implementation has the following features and please read [Usage](#usage) for technical information..

1. A Websocket broker server. 
2. The main use case is for constrained devices (eg. microcontrollers) to sending data streams to the web.

It's an reference implementation of concepts of W3C Web of Things Framework.

## Install

1. [Download dotcity-wot-framework](https://github.com/wotcity/dotcity-wot-framework).
2. Run `$ cd dotcity-wot-framework` to change the directory.
3. Run `$ npm install` to install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
4. Run `$ node servers/websocket-broker.js` to start the WoT websocket server.

The server is running at `ws://localhost:8000`.

### Tests

1. Open a new terminal and run `$ cd tests` to enter the directory of test scripts.
2. Run `$ node send.js` to start sending streaming data to WoT websocket server.
3. Open a new terminal and run `$ node viewer.js` to start receiving streaming data over websocket. 

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Note: Node should be with a version above 0.10.x.

## Usage

To send the data over the Internet, IoT devices should use the url below to establish a connection with the server.

```
ws://[hostname]/object/[name]/send
```

You must specify an object name and your hostname. For example:

```
ws://localhost:8000/object/frontdoor/send
```

To receive data from the server, the frontend should use the url below to establish a connection with the server.

```
ws://localhost:8000/object/[name]/viewer
```

Also, you need to specify the object name and hostname. For example:

```
ws://localhost:8000/object/frontdoor/viewer
```

An physical object has two significant resources, *send* and *viewer*. *send* is to send device data to the server over Websocket connection. *viewer* could be used by web frontend to receive real-time data over the connection.

## Discussion

There are various ways to get involved with .CITY Web of Things Framework. We're looking for help identifying bugs, writing documentation and contributing codes.

You can also find us in the [#wotcity](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wotcity) IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
